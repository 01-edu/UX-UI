Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - Not that many. But throughout my life, I've tried many things. I go surfing sometimes, swimming quite a lot and I've tried skateboarding lately.
    - I run quite often though.
- How often do you run?
    - On average, probably 3 times a week.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Two days ago, on Tuesday. The last time was last week, probably on Thursday. When I started running it was for fitness, but now it's almost meditative. It's nice not to think about anything. Also for fitness as well, but now it has a really good effect on mental health.
    - How long: it depends. Probably like 6 km. Last year I was stuck in England for quite a while and I was running every day. Probably for half an hour.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - I haven't run many races. Maybe the last one was the half marathon in 2019 in Lisbon.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - The actual marathon was cool. It goes along the river. The view is very nice and it's not too demanding. However, the race was quite challenging. I remember it was quite a hot day. It was really hard. I started too fast because I wanted to do a good time, and I was quite exhausted at the end. I was trying to maintain the pace which was a bit stupid. I only had done 2 half-marathons in terms of distance. I didn't prepare myself enough, that was unpleasant. But I managed to finish and the experience was very nice, especially for the sense of achievement. Even though I pushed myself too much.
- How did you get prepared?
    - I did it with my friend. He had done a few half-marathons before. We were running every day in the morning. We started very casually. Not going that far or not setting targets. And gradually we increased the distances a little bit. From Lisbon to the bridge and back. Gradually we did it a bit quicker and shortened the time. This was his idea. We did some sprints in the middle of it, which was pretty nice. Then we ran from Carcavelos to Lisbon. It's good we did the full distance twice before the actual race.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - Probably more training. To do the actual distance a lot more. Doing the half marathon during the weekend because I found there was a big difference between 15 km and the actual 21 km. You need to be closer to the target. And do it something like 10 times the actual distance. We should have focused more on the details.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - I drank a lot after. But the big distance, I remember the day before, drink a lot. And on the way around they give you some hydration things. That's something I should have focused more on because I felt dehydrated.
- How did you manage your hydration?
    - For the first quarter of it, I was not thinking about it. But since it got hot, I really felt the heat and the fatigue. So I had the hydration bags they gave along with the race.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - Not exactly in trouble, but it was the limit. I was basically super tired. The day before I ate a lot. I should have slept more. We did some stretching but not enough.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Being unrealistic about the pace. I ran it in 1 hour and 43! The target was 1h45. But that was unrealistic. I was pushing myself.
    - When I run normally, I try to drink a lot before and a lot after. It's better to get prepared in the winter.

**Nathan, 39 years old, entrepreneur in agriculture, from the US, lives in Lisbon, Portugal**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - Running, sailing, kiteboarding. But sailing and kiteboarding are not very often. I haven't done any sailing or kiteboarding in over a year. In San Francisco it was different. I lived there for 6 years, and I moved to Lisbon 2 years ago.
- How often do you run?
    - When it comes to running, I go once or twice a week.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Last Thursday so 7 days ago. And the Tuesday before.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - Thanksgiving 10K last year in Ohio. I had arrived 5 days before in the US.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - Painful. I was out of shape and jetlagged. I didn't run frequently enough for the race. And I ran so fast. But I managed to finish.
- How did you get prepared?
    - Normal running once or twice a week. Mostly alone. Occasionally people would run with me. But I went to the race with my brother-in-law.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - It was a race for enjoyment and not pure competition. When I was young I raced competitively.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - I don't hydrate a lot before the race because the water hurts my stomach. I drink a little a few hours before but not immediately before.
- How did you manage your hydration?
    - For a race, I just make sure I don't go to race dehydrated, access from my normal day-to-day.
    - I run between 5 and 10 kilometers. I'll be thirsty after the run. It's poorly managed. I'm really dehydrated. I run to get cured of my hangover and to help me think, it's very helpful. It's very much meditation for me. That's 90% of my joy of running. And I don't listen to music because it's distracting for me.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - Yes. There have been times in life, on a run, on a bicycle ran; my thoughts were less clear, you can feel it in your muscles. Your thought slows down, your body slows down also. It becomes very hard and your sweat changes. I remember riding a bike in a cascade mountain. I started to wobble on my bike. I stopped to eat some candy, drink, lay down for 30 minutes, and go back.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Going on a backpacking trip without accessible water. If you have some time to contain your drink that's helpful.

- **Guillaume, 30 years old, sales manager, lives in Paris, France**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - I've been practicing rugby for 10 years and I run several times a week. I got injured in 2012, followed by a bone graft which took me 3 years to recover.
- How often do you run?
    - It depends. Last November I ran 3 times in one month, whereas last week I ran 5 times. I usually run between 8 and 15 km.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Last Sunday, I ran 8 km in 45 minutes.
    - I love eating! Running gives a good way to balance. I am greedy and I love partying.
    - I always meet with someone when running: I'm a social runner! I don't have any problem with getting up early to meet with someone, but it's hard to get up if I run by myself. It's easier to stay motivated. I have three girlfriends with whom I run. Every weekend, I text the first one to know if she is available. If she is not, I text the second one and so on.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - My first marathon was 6 weeks ago.
    - Before that, my last race was 5 or 6 years ago.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - I was very good. I ran with a friend from km 20 to 30, and a couple of friends from km 30 to 40. When I arrived, I proposed to my girlfriend. All my friends were there.
    - There was much more pressure than in any other race. I had never run that distance. Only 2 weeks before the D-Day, I ran 30 km for the very first time. I realized only then how important it was to drink and eat all along the race.
- How did you get prepared?
    - The marathon was supposed to take place in March and was postponed to October. Back in March, my weight was 76kg, and in September, 88kg. In the meantime, I got injured at rugby, there were the summer holidays, and I trained again in September.
    - To run 30 km 2 weeks before the marathon, I needed 3 hours. I found someone to run with me the 30 km at a marathon pace. I was so exhausted. I needed water, I needed sugar. It was so hard.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - I should have stopped drinking alcohol much earlier, eaten healthier much earlier, stopped partying and eat correctly. And run short races at a fast pace.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - During the first 30 km race, I didn't get hydrated at all. I hadn't drunk a single glass of water before going. I am used to running between 10 and 20 km and I never drink when I run that distance.
    - I hydrated when I got home, I drank a lot of water. Probably 2 or 3 liters in the afternoon. But at night I drank 2 L of beer.
- How did you manage your hydration?
    - When you reach 20 km, you're far from home. You feel dizzy, your muscles begin to contract and tighten, your legs are heavier and heavier.
    - I drink Aquareus, which is an energy drink by Coca-Cola, like Powerade, and I ate fruits, mostly bananas.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - Yes, during that 30-km race.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Above 15 km, you should go with some water and snacks.
    

Next race

- I want to run the next half-marathon in March. I also want to run as a ‘rabbit’ for 10 to 15 km during the next marathon to support a friend. It's hard to maintain the same pace for 40 km, so we help each other out as 'rabbits': we run at a faster pace next to you so you can hold yours. In official races, it's tolerated.

**Anaëlle, 29 years old, consultant, French, lives in Paris, France**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - Running and muscle building. I have had a coach for 4 months. I do a one-hour session with him per week, based on running. Sheathing, slits, pumps, mobility exercises, stretching.
- How often do you run?
    - From 3 to 4 times a week.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Last Tuesday, 7 days ago. Last week was my birthday so I enjoyed it and didn't focus much on running.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - I will be back in preparation for the marathon in early January for the Paris marathon in early April 2022. With the current events (Covid), I could not do many races but I did several half marathons, 2x Marseille-Cassis (20km with elevation gain), 2x Paris-Versailles (16 km), and several 10km.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - In June 2019, I prepared the Caen half-marathon for the 75th year of the Normandy landing with an app called Decat'coach. The program is designed automatically according to the time you want to do it. My goal was: to do less than 1H50. But I arrived at the race washed out. I realized the training was not adapted to my shape and my structure. The start of the race was narrow, I was at the 2-hour pace, I accelerated, I burned myself from the 7-8th km. When I do a race, I prepare on a piece of paper at which minute to pass which kilometer. From the 10th, I broke down. Even though I hydrated, fueled, it didn’t change anything, it was too late, my legs exploded. I wanted to sprint at the finish line because my family was waiting for me. I did it, but the rescue team came to get me because I couldn’t stand anymore. They put me in a wheelchair with a survival blanket. I was very afraid that it would make me sick of running, and for a month and a half, I didn’t feel like it anymore. But I got over it and I remembered that the application I had used had made me too tired before the race.
    - For the marathon, I will be better followed by something that better fits my condition and my structure. I don’t have a time target, I just want to finish it.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - My sports coach will train me. There will be running, interval training, long runs, and stretching sessions.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - I try to drink 1.5L a day, I always have my bottle with me. What I missed was a camelback. You can quickly waste time. It’s not practical, they give you a cup of water during the race but it’s not practical. For the training, I will train with my camelback and for the long races, I will have water with me.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - When I do training sessions between 8 and 12 km, I try not to drink directly after my run. But in the summer I try to leave with little Decathlon bottles.
    The last time, I had forgotten my bottle. I was leaving for 14 km. I did not take it because it was not clean. I did the first 5 kilometers quickly then I lost the energy, I looked at my watch and my time was going down, I had no more juice. When it is very hot I avoid to leave without water.
    - On the docks in the summer there are small water fountains, it’s convenient even if it’s not very covid-friendly.
    - I’m going to test the camelback soon and I hope the backpack doesn’t bother me too much.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Forgetting my water in the hot weather.
    - I sometimes drink before I run, but it stays in my stomach, it’s awful. I’ll take a sip or two just before running. Or I try to drink well in the morning if I run at noon. Item of food.
    - After training, I drink my first sip half an hour after my session.
    - As to muscle strengthening, I drink during the workout session.
