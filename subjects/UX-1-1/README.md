Interview guide: 

Hello! My name is Agathe and I am conducting research about athletes and people who practice sports regularly. Hence, I'd be very happy to ask you some questions about the way you run, your habits, and the pain points you may have. 

This interview will probably last 20 to 30 minutes. 

Do you have any questions before we start? 

Run

- What sports do you practice?
- How often do you run?
- When was the last time you went out for a run?

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
- How did you get prepared?
- What would you have done differently? Why?

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
- How did you manage your hydration?
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
- What would you never do again? Why?

That's it, we went through all the questions I had. 

Thank you so much for your time!

I have a last favor to ask you: is there anyone you know who runs frequently and would be available for a talk?
