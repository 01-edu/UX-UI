# UI IV - Ex 3 - Design screens

**Instructions:**

Based on the wireframes and your design system library, take your mid-fidelity prototype to a high-fidelity level!

Select 5 screens that will show the user flow of a customer who: 

- arrives on the homepage
- browses the content
- checks one product page
- adds the product to the cart
- checks out

Use your components, call to actions and visuals to complete the wireframes. 

**Deliverables:** 

- 5 high-fidelity screens
