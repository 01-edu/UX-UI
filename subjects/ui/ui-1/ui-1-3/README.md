# UI I - Ex 3 - Color combinations

**Context:** 

This first UI quest is a series of exercises to practice colors, moodboards, typography and replicate screens on Figma!

**Instructions:** 

Let's browse! 

Find 3 digital products (websites or apps) that use each kind of color palette combination: 

- Monochromatic
- Analogous
- Complementary
- Split complementary
- Triadic
- Double complementary

**Deliverable:** 

- A PDF document extracted from a Figma file including for each
    - screenshots of the main page
    - the matching URL,
    - the main colors and
    - the kind of color combinaison.

**Tips:** 

- You can find HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) as well as HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) depending of the source.
