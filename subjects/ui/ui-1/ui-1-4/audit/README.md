#### Audit instructions

##### To have a good moodboard, make sure there are:

###### Several pictures that are graphically consistent
###### 2 to 3 main colors that stand out
###### The colors must have at least one code (RGB, Hex, or HSB)
###### Please check the code to make sure it matches with the designated color [thanks to this tool](http://onlinewebtool.com/colorpicker.php)
###### The document should be a PDF

##### Examples of moodboards (in addition, the moodboard should include the color codes):
