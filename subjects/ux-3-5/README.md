# UX III - Ex 5 CK - Personas

**Context:** 

Quest n°3 is about Empathy. 

In this scenario, the principal of your high school heard you were a designer. They chose to reach you to help them face school harassment among teenagers.

School harassment describes school-based harassment behaviors. It is characterized by the repeated use of violence, including mockery and other humiliations.

As a matter of fact, they realized they didn’t know this generation (15 to 18-year-olds) very well. So they are asking you to conduct user research to meet this population and understand them. 

Your job is to explore your topic and use various tools included in this “Empathize” phase.

**Instructions:** 

Let's create a persona based on your quantitative research and your interviews. 

Your persona card should include common trends amongst the people you got data from (habits, verbatims, fears, drivers, frustration, and pain points).

Reminder: Your persona is fictional and should not have the exact name or picture as someone you interviewed, but remember a persona is here so you can make decisions as a designer.

**Quotes:** 

- If you design for everyone, you delight no one.
- A good user persona is the one based on user research, without regard to how many attributes we can describe.
