# Project 1 - Get a room!

Creation of a room booking service on desktop

Barbara works at Coworking Square, which is a coworking place in Amsterdam. 

She needs help to manage bookings. Among the 50 spots that are in the working space, 35 can be rented by month or by week, and 15 are hot spots that can be booked for one day. 

For now, she manages everything with paper calendars but that’s not really efficient. 

‘I wish my clients could book spots weekly, monthly or daily online and pay everything upfront so I don’t have to deal with billing above all’

She calls you to design a website that could solve her problem.

You have to meet her after one week to give a first presentation of your work, after completing a tested mid-fidelity prototype. 

The final presentation of your work will take place one week after the mid presentation, where you’ll show a tested high-fidelity prototype.

Estimated time: 2 weeks

Team size: 1

Guidelines: 

- You may consider building your UX and UI strategy before jumping in. Remember to question the initial brief with user research.
- Beware all the steps of the design process: Empathy, Define, Problem Statement, Ideation, Prototype, Test
- Make a presentation as if you were showing your work to your client. Make sure there are at least 5 people in the audience who can give consistent feedback thanks to the audit.
