# UX III - Ex 7 CK - Problem Statement

**Context:** 

Quest n°3 is about Empathy. 

In this scenario, the principal of your high school heard you were a designer. They chose to reach you to help them face school harassment among teenagers.

School harassment describes school-based harassment behaviors. It is characterized by the repeated use of violence, including mockery and other humiliations.

As a matter of fact, they realized they didn’t know this generation (15 to 18-year-olds) very well. So they are asking you to conduct user research to meet this population and understand them. 

Your job is to explore your topic and use various tools included in this “Empathize” phase.

**Instructions:** 
Based on your previous work, your persona and your user journey's main painpoint, define a problem statement that would clarify the main problem you want to tackle.
You may use the How Might We exercise in pairs. 

Then, define 3 KPIs (Key performance Indicators) that will help you measure the definition of Done and the success of the solution.

**Deliverables:** 

- 1 problem statement
- 3 KPIs to measure the impact of the solution
