# UX III - Ex 3 - Broadcast strategy

**Instructions:** 

Define and run your broadcast strategy among teenagers (15-18 years old)

Even though a proper survey requires at least 100 answers, for this exercise we request you to get 40.

**Deliverables:** 

- A PDF document gathering your strategy. Please include:
    - Who you are targeting (remember, you can focus on your hometown as well as the whole planet)
    - A few ideas about how to reach them
    - The channels you intend to use - be specific and include the links to the groups, forums, pages, account you plan to reach
    - At least 2 different messages
    - A plan A, a plan B, a plan C
- A document to express your main feedback after running your broadcast strategy: what worked best? have you encountered any difficulties? What were they? How did you overcome them?

**Tips:**

In order to do so, you need to be creative and strategic!

- Who are you targeting? Teenagers, bullies, persecutor, witnesses, parents, teachers, people in the administration? From where?
- How can you reach them? Through which channels? On which forums, groups, with which hashtags? Will you try to get them through influencers?
- What words and what tone will you use?
- How will you approach them? What message will you write?
- What have you planned if they don't answer right away?

Once your strategy is prepared, run it!
