# UX III - Ex 5 - Personas

**Instructions:** 

Let's create a persona based on your quantitative research and your interviews. 

Your persona card should include common trends amongst the people you got data from (habits, verbatims, fears, drivers, frustration, and pain points).

Reminder: Your persona is fictional and should not have the exact name or picture as someone you interviewed, but remember a persona is here so you can make decisions as a designer. 

**Deliverables:**

- A PDF persona card extracted from a Figma file

**Quotes:** 

- If you design for everyone, you delight no one.
- A good user persona is the one based on user research, without regard to how many attributes we can describe.
