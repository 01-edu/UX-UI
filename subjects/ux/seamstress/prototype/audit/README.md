#### Audit

###### Is there a paper prototype with 6 to 12 different screens?
###### Are there mid-fidelity wireframes on Figma?
###### Do the mid-fidelity wireframes match the paper prototype?
###### Are the paper prototypes and wireframes in black, grey and white and do not include any style elements?
###### Does each screen have the main navigation elements (arrows, menu, call to actions)?
###### Does each screen follow the other?
###### Is the navigation fluid from the beginning to the end?
###### If there are user flows or card-sorting, do they match the criteria (from the instructions section)?
###### Is there a PDF document with the key learnings the students learnt from this phase?
