- Key learnings from this phase
- Vocabulary
    - Low-Fidelity: Paper Prototypes - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5nUfqqA2gjdAYHagjbHA5w.jpeg)
    - Mid-Fidelity: Wireframes - black and white, only the main elements, on digital prototype tools - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*eGSfaxwYbxUFomYbyO6GWw.png)
    - High-Fidelity: Wireframes with color, styles, graphical details, and micro-interactions - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Xn0HSKAvhr4TZzC9lN5udw.gif)

**Tips:**

- Use as many tools as needed, and make sure you do all the process in 4 working days!
- You may use Card Sorting and User flows

**Criteria:**


#### Criteria

 - User Flow
    
    Make sure for each flow: 
    
     - The user has a specific goal
     - There is a starting point and and ending point - which is the goal of the user
     - There is a series of actions organised in rectangles (actions) or diamond (choice)
     - The actions are linked with arrows
    
 - Card sorting
    
    Make sure
    
     - There is a script including the research goals.
     - The research goals must be close to "rearrange the content"
     - There are pictures of the ongoing workshop
     - There is a new content organization shown in a table with sticky notes (it can be a picture or digital)
