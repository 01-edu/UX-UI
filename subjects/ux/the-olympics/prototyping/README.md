# UX IV - Ex 5 - Prototyping

**Instructions:** 

Give another dimension to your user flow and turn your user flow into a paper prototype (12 screens max).

First, draw low-fidelity prototypes on paper. One main screen = 1 mobile frame. 

Then, draw your mid-fidelity screens on Figma with simple shapes, in black and white.

- Mid-Fidelity: Wireframes - black and white, only the main elements, on digital prototype tools - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*eGSfaxwYbxUFomYbyO6GWw.png)
- High-Fidelity: Wireframes with color, styles, graphical details, and micro-interactions - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Xn0HSKAvhr4TZzC9lN5udw.gif)

**Deliverables:**

**Quotes:** 

- ‘If you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late’ Reid Hoffman | LinkedIn
- To prototype your solution, you’ll need a temporary change of philosophy: from perfect to just enough, from long-term quality to temporary simulation.
- The prototype is meant to answer questions, so keep it focused. You just need a real-looking facade to which customers can react.
