# UX IV - Ex 7 - Test

**Context:** 

The Olympics committee calls on you to get fresh ideas for the next Olympic Games.

You’ll team up by groups of 3 and focus each on one problem statement. 

You’ll get guidelines and suggestions to run ideation workshops, and bring your ideas to life with three different prototypes, that you will animate and test. 

**Instructions:** 

Test your wireframe prototype with 5 different people and write down the 5 main iterations that need to be made on the next version. 

This exercise is to be made individually.

**Deliverables:** 

- A usability test script
- Pictures of the ongoing tests
- The list of the 5 main iterations that you'd like to do on the next version
- A report on what you learnt

**Quote:** 

Prototypes are created for testing purposes, that’s why creating a prototype without running tests on it makes no sense.
