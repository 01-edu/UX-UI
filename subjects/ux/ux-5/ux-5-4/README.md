# UX V - Ex 4 - Card sorting

**Context:** 

A music label specialized in music from South America asks you to improve the user experience. This quest is about heuristics and content organization!

**Instructions:** 

In the present situation, the websites are not ideal to complete the Jobs-to-be-Done your user has in mind. So let's practice card sorting to rearrange the content of the website!

Organize a card sorting workshop with the content of the website you chose in Ex. 1.

To do so:

- Define your research goals
- Prepare the material
- Find participants
- Run a card sorting workshop on 5 people
- Suggest a new taxonomy (content organization)

**List of websites:** 

- [Universal Music Latin America](https://www.universalmusica.com/)
- [Delta Records](https://deltarecords.net/)
- [Zoho Music](https://www.zohomusic.com/)
- [Luaka Bop](https://www.luakabop.com/)
- [Rimas Music](https://rimasmusic.com/)
- More... as long as it is a South American music label ;-)

**Deliverables:** 

- A card sorting workshop script with the research goals
- Pictures of the ongoing workshop
- A document to show the new content organization (it can be a picture of the board with sticky notes or the digital version).
