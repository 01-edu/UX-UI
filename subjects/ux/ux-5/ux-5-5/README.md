# UX V - Ex 5 - Wireframes

**Context:** 

A music label specialized in music from South America asks you to improve the user experience. This quest is about heuristics and content organization!

**Instructions:** 

Pick a product (a record, a song or an album) from your music label website.

Based on the new taxonomy (content categorization), show the different paths a user has to take to reach the product with a series of wireframes.  

**Tips:** 

- Drawing a user journey first might be helpful before rushing into wireframes
- Drawing paper prototypes before going digital might save you some time ;)

Vocabulary 

- Low-Fidelity: Paper Prototypes - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5nUfqqA2gjdAYHagjbHA5w.jpeg)
- Mid-Fidelity: Wireframes - black and white, only the main elements, on digital prototype tools - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*eGSfaxwYbxUFomYbyO6GWw.png)
- High-Fidelity: Wireframes with color, styles, graphical details, and micro-interactions - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Xn0HSKAvhr4TZzC9lN5udw.gif)
