# UX VI - Ex 7 - Iteration

**Instructions:** 

Based on your previous tests, pick one of your 3 prototypes.

Implement the 3 ideas you wrote down as suggestions. 

Run another series of test (and adapt your test protocol if necessary).

Write a report with the conclusion you made out of this iteration loop. 

**Deliverables:** 

- Pictures of the new test
- A report with your conclusions, your impressions and your key learnings from this iteration (PDF document out of Microsoft Word, Pages, Google Docs or any word-processing software)
- Comparison between V1 and V2 of the prototype

**Tips:** 

- This report will be handed on to the CEO. Pay attention to the details and make sure the document is clean and easy to use!
