# UX VI - Ex 1 - User flow

**Context:** 

Your company's client is a movie theaters chain called, Movie 4 all. 

They want to launch a platform for people who want to watch movies but donâ€™t want to spend endless time selecting one.
You are replacing someone in the company who has already worked on the user research, the problem statement and the list of features they plan to develop. Your goal is to prototype and test these features.

**Instructions:** 

Based on the 3 features that have come out of the ideation workshops led by your collegues, design 3 user flows (1 per feature). 

Features: 

- 1: Adding a filter based on their current mood
- 2: Offer a selection of 3 movies to be watched
- 3: Ask users to rate the movie after watching it for further recommendation

**Deliverables:** 

- 3 user flows on a board (digital or physical)
