#### Audit instructions

##### Make sure: 

###### The problem statement is written with a How Might We question
###### It includes the user's main goal
###### It includes the user's main pain
###### It is narrow enough
###### It is broad enough

Examples: 

- How might we help friends manage shopping groceries before a weekend to enjoy most of the time they have together?
    - Appropriate scope
- How might we make sure everyone is entitled to specific tasks so no one feels unfairly overwhelmed?
    - Appropriate scope
- How might we make sure everyone spends a good weekend?
    - Too broad: This problem statement does not include the relationship between one another
- How might we make sure who is in charge of the shopping list?
    - Too narrow: This problem statement is very specific and answering it may not solve the overall problem.
