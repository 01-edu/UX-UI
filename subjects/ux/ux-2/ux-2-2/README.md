# UX II - Ex 2 - Run interviews

**Context:** 

Welcome to the 2nd quest. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to focus on going on holidays with friends. As you may have noticed, experiencing weekends or other kinds of holidays is super nice, but may lead to some moments of irritation. 

So this project’s goal is to make holidays more comfortable fo everyone. But first, as in all design processes, you need to understand the real problem behind stressful moments!

**Instructions:** 

Run 6 interviews. Go in pairs, one being the interviewer and the other the note taker. 
Go outside! Meet random people in cafés, at the bus, on city squares, in parks, on benches, introduce yourself and ask for 15 minutes of their time. Run your interview guide and write down anything that could be helpful, like reactions, hesitations, etc. You can use a dictaphone to make sure you're not missing anything. But in this case, let the interviewee know and ask for their permission!
You can offer them a coffee to thank them, sometimes a smile suffices! 
At least 3 of your interviews must be with strangers. You'd be surprised how people are happy to help and looooove talking about themselves. 

Then, write down the script on a written document, and give elements of context regarding each interview (place, time, name, etc.)
