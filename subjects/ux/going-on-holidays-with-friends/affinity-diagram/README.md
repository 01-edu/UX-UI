# UX II - Ex 3 - Affinity diagram & Empathy map

**Instructions:**

Open your written scripts and extract the relevant information. 

1. Use paper or digital sticky notes (Post-its or Miro.com) to isolate the pieces of information your interviewees shared with you. 
1 idea, quote, or piece of information = 1 sticky note. 
2. When all your scripts are written/typed down on sticky notes, gather them in clusters based on themes, opinions, habits, or anything they could have in common. 
3. Label the clusters.
4. Draw conclusions
5. Fill an empathy map ONLY with the content from your affinity diagram.

**Deliverables:** 

- An Affinity Diagram (paper or on digital tools like Miro)
- An Empathy Map (paper or on digital tools like Miro)
