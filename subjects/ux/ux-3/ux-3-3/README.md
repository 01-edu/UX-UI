# UX III - Ex 3 CK - Broadcast strategy

**Context:** 

Quest n°3 is about Empathy. 

In this scenario, the principal of your high school heard you were a designer. They chose to reach you to help them face school harassment among teenagers.

School harassment describes school-based harassment behaviors. It is characterized by the repeated use of violence, including mockery and other humiliations.

As a matter of fact, they realized they didn’t know this generation (15 to 18-year-olds) very well. So they are asking you to conduct user research to meet this population and understand them. 

Your job is to explore your topic and use various tools included in this “Empathize” phase.

**Instructions:** 

Define and run your broadcast strategy among teenagers (15-18 years old)

Even though a proper survey requires at least 100 answers, for this exercise we request you to get 40.

**Deliverables:** 

- A document gathering your strategy. Please include:
    - Who you are targeting (remember, you can focus on your hometown as well as the whole planet)
    - A few ideas about how to reach them
    - The channels you intend to use - be specific and include the links to the groups, forums, pages, account you plan to reach
    - At least 2 different messages
    - A plan A, a plan B, a plan C
- A document to express your main feedback after running your broadcast strategy: what worked best? have you encountered any difficulties? What were they? How did you overcome them?

**Tips:**

In order to do so, you need to be creative and strategic!

- Who are you targeting? Teenagers, bullies, persecutor, witnesses, parents, teachers, people in the administration? From where?
- How can you reach them? Through which channels? On which forums, groups, with which hashtags? Will you try to get them through influencers?
- What words and what tone will you use?
- How will you approach them? What message will you write?
- What have you planned if they don't answer right away?

Once your strategy is prepared, run it!
