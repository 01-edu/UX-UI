# UX VI - Ex 7 - Iteration

**Context:** 

Your company's client is a movie theaters chain called, Movie 4 all. 

They want to launch a platform for people who want to watch movies but donâ€™t want to spend endless time selecting one.
You are replacing someone in the company who has already worked on the user research, the problem statement and the list of features they plan to develop. Your goal is to prototype and test these features.

**Instructions:** 

Based on your previous tests, pick one of your 3 prototypes.

Implement the 3 ideas you wrote down as suggestions. 

Run another series of test (and adapt your test protocol if necessary).

Write a report with the conclusion you made out of this iteration loop. 

**Deliverables:** 

- Pictures of the new test
- A report with your conclusions, your impressions and your key learnings from this iteration (PDF document out of Microsoft Word, Pages, Google Docs or any word-processing software)
- Comparison between V1 and V2 of the prototype

**Tips:** 

- This report will be handed on to the CEO. Pay attention to the details and make sure the document is clean and easy to use!
