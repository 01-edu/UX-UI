# UX I - Ex 5 CK - Problem Statement

**Context:** 

Welcome to the very first quest of this program. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to improve athletes’ experience related to their hydration when running. 

This first project is very special: you are asked to end up with a non-digital solution. As a matter of fact, innovation does not always rhyme with digital. So let’s be creative and get out of the box! 

**Instructions:**

Based on the insights from the analytics and user interviews, comment the scope of possible problem statements.

**Insights:** 

- From user interviews:
    - Runs several times a week (Joe, Nathan, Guillaume, Anaelle)
    - Doesn’t drink too much right before the race because it hurts their stomach (Nathan, Anaelle)
    - I run races with friends or peers (Joe, Nathan, Guillaume)
    - Running is a form of meditation for me (Joe, Nathan)
    - I should have trained more and better, I pushed myself very hard (Joe, Nathan, Guillaume, Anaelle)
    - I managed to finish (Joe, Nathan, Guillaume, Anaelle)
    - I felt dehydrated  (Joe, Nathan, Guillaume, Anaelle)
    - I have already planned to run another race in a few months (Guillaume, Anaelle)
    - I mostly drink after the race (Joe, Guillaume, Anaelle)

- From analytics:
    - Symptoms of dehydration can be headache, dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, or fatigue.
    - Analyzing urine is a good way to measure dehydration.
    - People experience dehydration when they loose 2% of their body mass loss (BML) in fluids / water / sweat.
    - Sweat helps the body to maintain optimal body temperature.
    - Sprint athletes are generally less concerned about the effects of dehydration than are endurance athletes.
    - Hyperhydration can compromise atheltic performance and increase health risks.
    - Endurance athletes should drink beverages containing carbohydrate and electrolyte during and after training or competition.

Possible problem statements: 

- How might we help Pierre (or your persona) measure and prepare his hydration before a race?
- How might we make sure Pierre doesn’t get dehydrated?
- How might we make sure Pierre drinks the cups that are offered during the race?
- How might we provide Pierre some drink that contains everything he needs to avoid dehydration?
- How might make sure Pierre doesn’t get drunk the night before the race?

**Deliverables:**

- For each problem statement, define if the scope is (1) too broad, (2) too narrow, (3) focused on the solution, not on the problem, (4) out of scope or (5) appropriate

**Tips:** 

- At this stage, it’s important to focus on the problem, not on the solution! You can start tackling the problem after (re)defining it.
- Several problem statements can be possible for each persona and user journey, but for this exercise, we are guiding you towards one.
