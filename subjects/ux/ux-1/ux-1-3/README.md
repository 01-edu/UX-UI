# UX I - Ex 3 - Personas

**Context:** 

Welcome to the very first quest of this program. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to improve athletes’ experience related to their hydration when running. 

This first project is very special: you are asked to end up with a non-digital solution. As a matter of fact, innovation does not always rhyme with digital. So let’s be creative and get out of the box! 

**Instructions:** 

- Create a user persona
- Answer the following questions:
    - Which of the user interviews did you use to make your persona? (referring to exercise 1)
    - What is your persona’s gender?
    - How old is your persona?

**Deliverables:** 

- Answers to the questions
- A user persona (PDF document)

**Tips:** 

- You may use Figma.
- Use the material you got from exercise 1.
- Detect people who face the same kinds of problems and group them.
- When you find 2+ people who face the same kind of problem, you can merge their testimonials to create a persona.
- A persona is fictional: do not use one of your users’ names, but a name that is consistent with your users’ demographics and social group.
- As to the age, average the ages of your selected users.
