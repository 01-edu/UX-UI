# UX I - Ex 4 CK - User Journey

**Context:** 

Welcome to the very first quest of this program. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to improve athletes’ experience related to their hydration when running. 

This first project is very special: you are asked to end up with a non-digital solution. As a matter of fact, innovation does not always rhyme with digital. So let’s be creative and get out of the box! 

**Instructions:** 

Based on your persona card, and the interview scripts, design Pierre’s user journey. 

*You can replace Pierre with your own persona.*

**Deliverables:** 

- A PDF document with Pierre’s user journey.

**Tips:** 

- You may use Figma.
- Mix up some insights and details from the interview scripts to write a journey that is consistent with Pierre’s personality.
- You can, for instance, describe Pierre’s first marathon. The first phase could be the preparation, the second phase the race itself, and the third one how he feels about the race when he has done it.
- Break down the story step-by-step and define Pierre’s actions.
- Focus on each action and define Pierre’s thoughts and main emotion among the list.
- Adapt the line to Pierre’s thoughts and emotions.
- Define the opportunities to improve Pierre’s overall experience every time you see a pain point.

**Resources:** 

Most articles you'll find will be about user journeys or customer journeys. Keep in mind that you can adapt this methodology to any persona with any kind of situation or process, even at school, outside the school, in the digital world, etc.
