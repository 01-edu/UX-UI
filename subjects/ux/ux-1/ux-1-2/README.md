# UX I - Ex 2 CK - Analytics

**Context:** 

Welcome to the very first quest of this program. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to improve athletes’ experience related to their hydration when running. 

This first project is very special: you are asked to end up with a non-digital solution. As a matter of fact, innovation does not always rhyme with digital. So let’s be creative and get out of the box! 

**Instructions:** 

Read these articles and extract at least 5 key figures or insights that may be useful in understanding what athletes or sport practicing people experience related to hydration.
