# UX I - Ex 6 CK - Ideation

**Context:** 

Welcome to the very first quest of this program. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to improve athletes’ experience related to their hydration when running. 

This first project is very special: you are asked to end up with a non-digital solution. As a matter of fact, innovation does not always rhyme with digital. So let’s be creative and get out of the box! 

**Instructions:** 

*You can replace Pierre with your own persona.*

The chosen problem statement is: “How might we help Pierre (or your persona) measure and prepare his hydration before a race?”

Now, let’s find creative solutions! Remember, the solution should not be digital! Forget about devices for this quest ;)

Find 3 friends outside of the program and run a quick ideation session (20 minutes). 

- What you need for an in-person ideation workshop:
    - Prepare some papers or sticky notes, stickers, a jar, and pens.
    - A closed room for 20 minutes where everyone feels comfortable
- Directions:
    - Ask them to turn off their phones
    - Explain the context and introduce Pierre (or your persona)
    - Explain the goal:
        - Let’s find as many solutions as possible to the question: “How might we help Pierre (or your persona) measure and prepare his hydration before a race?”, given the following contraints (unveil them one after the other: 1 minute per constraint, 1 constraint per round):
            - If Pierre was blind
            - If Pierre was a bird
            - If Pierre was a billionaire
            - If Pierre had a twin who was constantly with him
            - If Pierre was 5 years old
            - If Pierre had 5 arms
            - If Pierre was 105 years old
            - If Pierre was very clumsy
            - If Pierre was very forgetful (and lost memory every 5 minutes)
            - If Pierre was deaf
            - If Pierre was a turtle
            - If Pierre was naked
            - If Pierre couldn’t stop talking 24/7
            - If Pierre was always late
            - If Pierre was dishonest
    - Set a timer for each round.
    - Ask the participants to do, at each round, the following:
        - Write down their ideas on a sticky note (1 idea per sticky note)
        - Read them out loud
        - Put the sticky note in a jar
    - Gather all the ideas.
    - Give the participants 3 stickers each and ask them to vote for the best three options.
    - If there isn’t a solution that stands out of the crowd, hang them on a board and organize them according to these two parameters: easy to implement and efficient. Example in the resources.
    - Choose 1 main idea to solve the problem

**Deliverables:** 

- Pictures of the session
- A board with all the ideas (on paper or digitally on Miro or Figma)
- One main idea to solve the problem

Chances are that... If you have gone through all possible solutions, you’ve found the good one.
