# UX I - Ex 1 - User Interviews

**Context:** 

Welcome to the very first quest of this program. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to improve athletes’ experience related to their hydration when running. 

This first project is very special: you are asked to end up with a non-digital solution. As a matter of fact, innovation does not always rhyme with digital. So let’s be creative and get out of the box! 

**General recommendations:** 

- Get Out of the Box. Be curious. Follow design trends on YouTube, LinkedIn, in podcasts, on Instagram accounts. Explore the internet when you discover a new concept. Build your own design culture.
- Document everything you do, take notes, open a medium account to identify and show your deliverables, thoughts and feedback. It will be useful for your portoflio!
- Trust the design process. One step after another.
- Design needs to fail. 
Failure is even a necessary step, but ideally it should happen before a product is launched, during the prototype and test phases
- Make connections. Use LinkedIn, your friends, friends of friends to frequently meet designers and ask them about how they practice design in their organization. Who know, some day thay may remember you and offer you a contract!
- Have fun!!

**Instructions:** 

- Read all the scripts carefully
- Answer these questions:
    - Frequency
        - Who runs races occasionally (one time)?
        - Who runs races regularly (more than once)?
        - Who runs races frequently (more than 3 times a year)?
    - Problems due to hydration
        - Who already found themselves in trouble due to lack of hydration?
        - Who never found themselves in trouble due to lack of hydration?
- Focus on those who already hurt themselves because of a lack of hydration and who run regularly. Extract at least 6 insights
    - Insights must be either shared by several people or consistent with what other people have already experienced
    - For each insight, name who said it.

**Deliverables:** 

- Answer the questions above
- Write at least 6 insights and the name of the person(s) who said it.
    
     
    

**Tips:** 

- The following is the interview script used to conduct the seven user interviews.
- Interview guide:

Hello! My name is Agathe and I am conducting research about athletes and people who practice sports regularly. Hence, I'd be very happy to ask you some questions about the way you run, your habits, and the pain points you may have. 

This interview will probably last 20 to 30 minutes.

- What sports do you practice?
- How often do you run?
- When was the last time you went out for a run?

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
- How did you get prepared?

- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
- What would you never do again? Why?

That's it, we went through all the questions I had. 

Thank you so much for your time!

I have a last favor to ask you: is there anyone you know who runs frequently and would be available for a talk?



# **Interview scripts**

**Antoine, 29 years old, CEO in a renewable energy company French, lives in Lisbon, Portugal**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - Regularly? Running mostly, I'm also trying to practice regularly tennis and kite surfing.
    - From time to time, I practice sailing, skiing, and surfing as well. And that's pretty much it. I'm not an athlete nor a professional trail runner.
- How often do you run?
    - It depends. When I have a good habit of running, I run 3 times a week. And when it's more irregular, I run once a week.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Yesterday evening. 42/43 minutes. I ran along the Tejo river, in LIsbon. It's a soft run, I didn't put too much effort into it. It's good to release pressure after work.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - The last race I ran was probably in August 2019. Then, there were not many opportunities due to Covid-19.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - It was cool. It was on a Sunday morning. It's the Sydney 2 Race. It's a race that goes from the city center to Bondi beach. 14km run with some hills, with 240m elevation gain. It's been a big race, with lots of people, the view is nice, you run along the bay. What was surprising was the lack of milestones along with the race. Usually, you have an indication at each kilometer. But there was almost none. I didn't manage to know the pace I was going at. I went way quicker than what I was aiming at the beginning, and I managed to keep up the pace. I ended up running faster than what I was prepared for.
- How did you get prepared?
    - By going running not on the same path, but through the same main hills during the previous weeks.
    - But I couldn't get prepared 3 times a week as I wanted to. What helped me was providing a similar effort regarding the amont of hills. That was not a proper preparation, as much as I would have liked.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - I would have set my priorities right. I would have gone running at least 3 times a week, to improve my pace and the way I dealt with the race.
    - Why: to run faster. To run the race in less than what I did. I already ran fast, but I could have run the race in less than one hour.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - I know we should not drink alcohol before the race. But I went out with friends and drank alcohol the night before. I went home early though.
    - Before running a race, you need to make sure you get hydrated the day before, as well as all the stupid things you should do the day before. You don't want to pee during the race. You have to go before.
- How did you manage your hydration?
    - I didn't have water with me but there were stands with cups of water available. I took the cups of water and drank a few sips.
    - It's better to have a few sips every once in a while than a lot at one specific moment because it cuts the effort. You want to drink slowly. If you run a trail with hills, it's better to drink after the effort rather than before a hill, during the effort.
- How did you prepare your hydration process?
    - I didn't prepare anything. I knew there were stands along with the race. It's a 14km race, it's not like a 50km race where you need your own water.
    - When I run on a flat course, I usually drink before and after the race. I drink water during long sessions. But that may not be what's best or convenient.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - Let me think... I don't think so. Not in running but when going on a long hike when I had to manage water. But I never ended up dehydrated.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Nothing
    

Next Race

- I'm thnking about registering for a race soon. Maybe the Paris half-marathon in March. It's good to have something to get ready for, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should find something near Lisbon, where I live.

- **Joe, 30 years old, translator, British, lives in Lisbon, Portugal**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - Not that many. But throughout my life, I've tried many things. I go surfing sometimes, swimming quite a lot and I've tried skateboarding lately.
    - I run quite often though.
- How often do you run?
    - On average, probably 3 times a week.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Two days ago, on Tuesday. The last time was last week, probably on Thursday. When I started running it was for fitness, but now it's almost meditative. It's nice not to think about anything. Also for fitness as well, but now it has a really good effect on mental health.
    - How long: it depends. Probably like 6 km. Last year I was stuck in England for quite a while and I was running every day. Probably for half an hour.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - I haven't run many races. Maybe the last one was the half marathon in 2019 in Lisbon.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - The actual marathon was cool. It goes along the river. The view is very nice and it's not too demanding. However, the race was quite challenging. I remember it was quite a hot day. It was really hard. I started too fast because I wanted to do a good time, and I was quite exhausted at the end. I was trying to maintain the pace which was a bit stupid. I only had done 2 half-marathons in terms of distance. I didn't prepare myself enough, that was unpleasant. But I managed to finish and the experience was very nice, especially for the sense of achievement. Even though I pushed myself too much.
- How did you get prepared?
    - I did it with my friend. He had done a few half-marathons before. We were running every day in the morning. We started very casually. Not going that far or not setting targets. And gradually we increased the distances a little bit. From Lisbon to the bridge and back. Gradually we did it a bit quicker and shortened the time. This was his idea. We did some sprints in the middle of it, which was pretty nice. Then we ran from Carcavelos to Lisbon. It's good we did the full distance twice before the actual race.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - Probably more training. To do the actual distance a lot more. Doing the half marathon during the weekend because I found there was a big difference between 15 km and the actual 21 km. You need to be closer to the target. And do it something like 10 times the actual distance. We should have focused more on the details.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - I drank a lot after. But the big distance, I remember the day before, drink a lot. And on the way around they give you some hydration things. That's something I should have focused on more because I felt dehydrated.
- How did you manage your hydration?
    - For the first quarter of it, I was not thinking about it. But since it got hot, I really felt the heat and the fatigue. So I had the hydration bags they gave along with the race.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - Not exactly in trouble, but it was the limit. I was basically super tired. The day before I ate a lot. I should have slept more. We did some stretching but not enough.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Being unrealistic about the pace. I ran it in 1 hour and 43! The target was 1h45. But that was unrealistic. I was pushing myself.
    - When I run normally, I try to drink a lot before and a lot after. It's better to get prepared in the winter.

-

**Nathan, 39 years old, entrepreneur in agriculture, from the US, lives in Lisbon, Portugal**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - Running, sailing, kiteboarding. But sailing and kiteboarding are not very often. I haven't done any sailing or kiteboarding in over a year. In San Francisco it was different. I lived there for 6 years, and I moved to Lisbon 2 years ago.
- How often do you run?
    - When it comes to running, I go once or twice a week.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Last Thursday so 7 days ago. And the Tuesday before.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - Thanksgiving 10K last year in Ohio. I had arrived 5 days before in the US.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - Painful. I was out of shape and jetlagged. I didn't run frequently enough for the race. And I ran so fast. But I managed to finish.
- How did you get prepared?
    - Normal running once or twice a week. Mostly alone. Occasionally people would run with me. But I went to the race with my brother-in-law.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - It was a race for enjoyment and not pure competition. When I was young I raced competitively.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - I don't hydrate a lot before the race because the water hurts my stomach. I drink a little a few hours before but not immediately before.
- How did you manage your hydration?
    - For a race, I just make sure I don't go to race dehydrated, access from my normal day-to-day.
    - I run between 5 and 10 kilometers. I'll be thirstly after the run. It's poorly managed. I'm really dehydrated. I run to get cured of my hangover and to help me think, it's very helpful. It's very much meditation for me. That's 90% of my joy of running. And I don't listen to music because it's distracting for me.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - Yes. There have been times in life, on run, on a biclycle ran; my thoughts were less clear, you can feel it in your muscles. Your thought slows down, your body slows down also. It becomes very hard and your sweat changes. I remember riding a bike in a cascade mountain. I started to wobble on my bike. I stopped to eat some candy, drink, lay down for 30 minutes, and go back.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Going on a backpacking trip without accessible water. If you have some time to contain your drink that's helpful.

- **William, 33, accountant, French, lives in Paris, France**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - I train for ultra trails. Ultra = over 50km, Trail = not on the road, in the mountains.
    - My specialty is to run very long races, beyond 3 days, over 300 km. Usually, it's between 50 and 162 km. There are races everywhere on the planet but in France, there is the highest density in the world racing, thanks to the diversity of relief.
    - I also do cycling and endurance, 100km minimum. I once ran 350km on my own. Swimming too but I haven't done it in years.
- How often do you run?
    - 5 times a week. When I train, I run 2 marathons per week.
    - When I go running, I run at least 15 km. I do cycles of 6 to 8 weeks, 1 week of break and I start a new cycle.
    - I run an official race every other week.
    - I am not a professional but I have been sponsored for the last 7 years, that pays for my equipment. Other than that, I'm an accountant in a large corporation.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Five days ago, last Monday, because I'm sick.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - Long ago! Because earlier this year, I was cycling and I fell and broke my collarbone in Ventou, France. I was practicing for the half-650km by bike.
    - Before that, the last race I ran was 80km in Paris in January 2021.
    - In trail: World Backyard Racing Championships in 2021. It is a 6.8km loop to do every hour. We start at fixed times. You have to run and be back in time to start again on a new loop. I was representing France. I lasted 34hours, so 220km. But I suffered from hypothermia and missed a start.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - It was incredible. We were 15 and we represented the French team. The country that ran the most laps won. The atmosphere there is very special. Everyone is there for a stopwatch, it’s more individual. There was solidarity between the riders and we had plenty of time to be with the other riders. It really was a social event.
- How did you get prepared?
    - Preparation is based on experience. It’s the accumulation of events that matters. After 30 or 40 races, what you need to train is your mental strength. You need to concentrate kilometers over years and years to make it easy on the D-day. You need to find comfort in discomfort. For my last race, it was 7 weeks of preparation, split, longer outings, 2 marathons per day.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - The speed is fixed, so I trained to have constant speed. I know my speed and my landmarks so that I can reproduce it on the D-Day. The time I spent not running, I could use it to rest. You have to be slow enough not to spend too much energy.
    - I would have changed clothes earlier not to have hypothermia. My preparation was good! I had already done that kind of race 6 or 7 times.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - I’m a pretty bad pupil. I drank water without additives and coca-cola, not at the same time though. In terms of diet; in coca-cola there is sugar and caffeine. Having both is perfect. I have been trying for quite a while to take energy drinks and so on. If you bring your own drinks, you have to be able to recharge with what exists on the race.
- How did you manage your hydration?
    - On very long runs, I also take BCAA amino acids. Those are normally secreted by my body, and I take them to rebuild stocks faster. It has an impact on fatigue.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - Yes, a thousand times! Not necessarily on the quality of hydration.
    - I once misplanned my salt: the hotter it is the more salt you need. Because the body evacuates through sweat. If you have less salt, you fall. It happened to me 2-3 times. You can buy salt tablets. It doesn’t taste like salt, and it’s in tablets. You also have salt shakers on the markers. In both cases it doesn't give the impression of thirst in the throat. Anyway, it's important to have was in fluids with you at all times.
    - There was another time when I was running through the Pyrenees on my own. At one point, on the plateaux of Ariège, I had to go 120 km without water except the one I had on me (3L). You normally run 120 km in 1 day and a half. I had been on a constant effort from 7 days (and I was drinking between 6 and 7 liters per day). I had a mental problem. You start to consider puddles of water. It was the end of October and I didn’t meet with a single person. When I finally saw a fountain where I could sleep, it was a resurrection! I drank 2.5L in 20 minutes. I drank all night and started running again the following day.
    
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Drinking energy drinks for the specific effort. They are good but there is a problem: you have to mix with your water, it sticks, it is not convenient. You’re getting used to having to deal with this.
    - What is the most optimal in absolute terms is not necessarily the most optimal at the moment. It is necessary to make the choice at the moment (take 1Kg of powder for an ultratrail).
    - If a drink is available on the stand, I take it.
    - Misjudge your journey.
    - Leave without salt or BC2A tablets. It takes up little space but it can save your ass.
    
- **Guillaume, 30 years old, sales manager, lives in Paris, France**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - I've been practicing rugby for 10 years and I run several times a week. I got injured in 2012, followed with a bone graft which took me 3 years to recover.
- How often do you run?
    - It depends. Last November I ran 3 times in one month, whereas last week I ran 5 times. I usually run between 8 and 15 km.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Last Sunday, I ran 8 km in 45 minutes.
    - I love eating! Running gives a good way to balance. I am greedy and I love partying.
    - I always meet with someone when running: I'm a social runner! I don't have any problem with getting up early to meet with someone, but it's hard to get up if I run by myself. It's easier to stay motivated. I have three girlfriends with whom I run. Every weekend, I text the first one to know if she is available. If she is not, I text the second one and so on.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - My first marathon was 6 weeks ago.
    - Before that, my last race was 5 or 6 years ago.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - I was very good. I ran with a friend from km 20 to 30, and a couple of friends from km 30 to 40. When I arrived, I proposed to my girlfriend. All my friends were there.
    - There was much more pressure than in any other race. I had never ran that distance. Only 2 weeks before the D-Day, I ran 30 km for the very first time. I realized only then how important it was to drink and eat all along the race.
- How did you get prepared?
    - The marathon was supposed to take place in March, and was postponed to October. Back in March, my weight was 76kg, and in September, 88kg. In the meantime, I got injured at rugby, there were the summer holidays, and I trained again in September.
    - To run 30 km 2 weeks before the marathon, I needed 3 hours. I found someone to run with me the 30 km with a marathon pace. I was so exhausted. I needed water, I needed sugar. It was so hard.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - I should have stopped drinking alcohol much earlier, eaten healthier much earlier, stopped partying and eaten correctly. And run short races at a fast pace.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - During the first 30 km race I didn't get hydrated at all. I hadn't drunk a single glass of water before going. I am used to running between 10 and 20 km and I never drink when I run that distance.
    - I hydrated when I got home, I drank a lot of water. Probably 2 or 3 liters in the afternoon. But at night I drank 2 L of beer.
- How did you manage your hydration?
    - When you reach 20 km, you're far from home. You feel dizzy, your muscles begin to contract and tighten, your legs are heavier and heavier.
    - I drink Aquareus, which is an energy drink by Coca-Cola, like Powerade, and I ate fruits, mostly bananas.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - Yes, during that 30-km race.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Above 15 km, you should go with some water and snacks.
    

Next race

- I want to run the next half-marathon in March. I also want to run as a ‘rabbit’ for 10 to 15 km during the next marathon to support a friend. It's hard to maintain the same pace for 40 km, so we help each other out as 'rabbits': we run at a faster pace next to you so you can hold yours. In official races, it's tolerated.

**Guillemette, 31 years old, accountant freelance, French, lives in Nantes, France**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - I swim and run.
- How often do you run?
    - I swim once or twice a month.
    - As to running, I haven't run in 9 months due to my pregnancy, but I normally run once a week.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - 9 months ago!

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - 'Les foulées du numériques 2020' in Nantes. It's a 10km race.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - The race was hard to run because it had been a long time since I hadn't run. You need to run regularly and I was not prepared enough. I had a tendancy to run faster than my own pace and I found it harder.
    - Half marathon in 2018. It was not too hot and the program was well done. I stopped a little longer (I ran on the spot) to take the time to drink. I had been very careful about that. I had a sore feet. It was a nice experience and a good challenge and I didn't have any hydration problems. We also had a friend who coached us for the half-marathon, she did a lot of prevention on hydration, the importance of taking breaks, slowing down, etc.
- How did you get prepared?
    - I ran a little more regularly and tried to run at least 10 km in my training sessions.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - I would re-train by step rather than several times 10 km. Increase as you go. I thought my body could do it, so I could do it in the moment. But I wasn’t ready.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - I drink after each workout minimum 1 L of water, it limits the aches. I force myself to drink 1 L of water. I watch out hydration before the course. There’s only one supply on the 10km race so I drank halfway through.
- How did you manage your hydration?
    - Very badly I think. Because you would have to drink more at the time of training when I do not drink before. You have to train your body before the effort and it goes through hydration.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - No, never, because I am very careful.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Drinking too fast

-

**Anaëlle, 29 years old, consultant, French, lives in Paris, France**

Run

- What sports do you practice?
    - Running and muscle building. I have had a coach for 4 months. I do a one-hour session with him per week, based on running. Sheathing, slits, pumps, mobility exercises, stretching.
- How often do you run?
    - From 3 to 4 times a week.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
    - Last Tuesday, 7 days ago. Last week was my birthday so I enjoyed it and didn't focus much on running.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
    - I will be back in preparation for the marathon in early January for the Paris marathon in early April 2022. With the current events (Covid), I could not do many races but I did several half marathons, 2x Marseille-Cassis (20km with elevation gain), 2x Paris-Versailles (16 km), and several 10km.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
    - In June 2019, I prepared the Caen half-marathon for the 75th year of the Normandy landing with an app called Decat'coach. The program is designed automatically according to the time you want to do it. My goal: to do less than 1H50. But I arrived at the race washed out. I realized the training was not adapted to my shape and my structure. The start of the race was narrow, I was at the 2-hour pace, I accelerated, I burned myself from the 7-8th km. When I do a race, I prepare on a piece of paper at which minute to pass which kilometer. From the 10th, I broke down. Even though I hydrated, fueled, it didn’t change anything, it was too late, my legs exploded. I wanted to sprint at the finish line because my family was waiting for me. I did it, but the rescue team came to get me because I couldn’t stand anymore. They put me in a wheelchair with a survival blanket. I was very afraid that it would make me sick of running, and for a month and a half, I didn’t feel like it anymore. But I got over it and I remembered that the application I had used had made me too tired before the race.
    - For the marathon, I will be better followed by something that better fits my condition and my structure. I don’t have a time target, I just want to finish it.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
    - My sports coach will train me. There will be running, interval training, long runs, and stretching sessions.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
    - I try to drink 1.5L a day, I always have my bottle with me. What I missed was a camelback. You can quickly waste time. It’s not practical, they give you a cup with water during the race but it’s not practical. For the training, I will train with my camelback and for the long races I will have water with me.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
    - When I do training sessions between 8 and 12 km, I try not to drink directly after my run. But in the summer I try to leave with little Decathlon bottles.
    The last time, I had forgotten my bottle. I was leaving for 14 km. I did not take it because it was not clean. I did the first 5 kilometers quickly then I lost the energy, I looked at my watch and my time was going down, I had no more juice. When it is very hot I avoid to leave without water.
    - On the docks in the summer there are small water fountains, it’s convenient even if it’s not very covid-friendly.
    - I’m going to test the camelback soon and I hope the backpack doesn’t bother me too much.
- What would you never do again? Why?
    - Forgetting my water in the hot weather.
    - I sometimes drink before I run, but it stays in my stomach, it’s awful. I’ll take a sip or two just before running. Or I try to drink well in the morning if I run at noon. Item of food.
    - After training, I drink my first sip half an hour after my session.
    - As to muscle strengthening, I drink during the workout session.
