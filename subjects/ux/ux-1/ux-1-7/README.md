# UX I - Ex 7 - Prototyping

**Context:** 

Welcome to the very first quest of this program. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to improve athletes’ experience related to their hydration when running. 

This first project is very special: you are asked to end up with a non-digital solution. As a matter of fact, innovation does not always rhyme with digital. So let’s be creative and get out of the box! 

**Instructions:** 

Develop your idea! 

Design a storyboard of Pierre (or your persona) using your idea as a solution. Show all the steps (from 6 to 12) with drawings on paper.

**Deliverables:** 

- 1 storyboard to describe your solution, on paper

**Tips:** 

- 1 drawing per action
