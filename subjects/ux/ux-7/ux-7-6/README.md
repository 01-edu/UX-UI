# UX VII - Ex 6 - Prototype

**Context:** 

Elsa is a seamstress. She makes swimsuits on demand through her instagram account. It's going well, her community is growing as well as the amount of requests from customers. 

However, she loses a lot of time every time there is a request. To complete an order, she needs to ask for the shape of the swimsuit, the size, the color preferences and the expected delivery time. On top of that, she needs to make sure she has enough time to sew one piece - every piece requires 6 hours. 

For now, she only works with private messages but she wishes she could spend less time on that part. 

You offer to help her design a solution to manage her time and workshop better. You have 4 working days.

**Instructions:** 

Make a prototype including the chosen solution. 

**Deliverables:** 

- A paper prototype (low-fi)
- An animated wireframe prototype (mid-fi)
- Key learnings from this phase
- Vocabulary
    - Low-Fidelity: Paper Prototypes - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5nUfqqA2gjdAYHagjbHA5w.jpeg)
    - Mid-Fidelity: Wireframes - black and white, only the main elements, on digital prototype tools - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*eGSfaxwYbxUFomYbyO6GWw.png)
    - High-Fidelity: Wireframes with color, styles, graphical details, and micro-interactions - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Xn0HSKAvhr4TZzC9lN5udw.gif)

**Tips:**

- Use as many tools as needed, and make sure you do all the process in 4 working days!
- You may use Card Sorting and User flows
