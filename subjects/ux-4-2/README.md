# UX IV - Ex 2 CK - Ideation

**Context:** 

The Olympics committee calls on you to get fresh ideas for the next Olympic Games.

You’ll team up by groups of 3 and focus each on one problem statement. 

You’ll get guidelines and suggestions to run ideation workshops, and bring your ideas to life with three different prototypes, that you will animate and test. 

**Instructions:**

Let's be creative!

Organize and run an ideation workshop with 4 - 8 participants to find ideas to solve this problem statement: 

**How might we provide relevant and on-demand information about the environmental and social impact of the Olympics through our platform?**

B is leader, C is time-keeper and A focuses on logistics.

Pay attention not to use the same ideation technique as in Ex 1!

**Deliverables:** 

- Script
- Pictures of the ongoing workshop
- Main concept out of the workshop
