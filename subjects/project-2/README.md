# Project 2: Let’s do some sports!

Creation of a sports app with data tracking on mobile and e-watch (data visualization)

Yara is a runner. She runs 5 times a week and she’s passionate! She’d like to challenge her own performance to make sure she is making progress. 

Yara uses an Apple Watch and her iPhone. 

‘I wish I could have consistent data about my trainings, more than what already exists. I can run with my watch and I’d like to analyse and share my results with my sport coach.”

She asks you to design an app on a watch and on mobile that could solve her problem.

You have to meet her after one week to give a first presentation of your work, after completing a tested mid-fidelity prototype. 

The final presentation of your work will take place one week after the mid presentation, where you’ll show a tested high-fidelity prototype.

Estimated time: 2 weeks

Team size: 2

Guidelines: 

- You may consider building your UX and UI strategy before jumping in. Remember to question the initial brief with user research.
- Beware all the steps of the design process: Empathy, Define, Problem Statement, Ideation, Prototype, Test
- Make a presentation as if you were showing your work to your client. Make sure there are at least 5 people in the audience who can give consistent feedback thanks to the audit.
