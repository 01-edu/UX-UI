# Project 3: Let’s fair trade

Creation of an ecommerce platform for second-hand clothes on desktop and mobile

Bruno loves fashion. He loves buying clothes! As he is cautious with the environment, he prefers buying second-hand clothing. However, the existing platforms are not very user-friendly.

‘I need to know more about the environmental impact of the pieces I buy. I’d like to know how old they are, where they are coming from, to measure their life and the amount of kilometres they have traveled. When a new pair of jeans arrive at the ready-to-wear store in Europe, they consumed approximately 11,000 litres of water and travelled 65,000 kilometres. I’d like to monitor that kind of data.’

You gather a team of 3 to think and design a website and an app for second-hand products. 

You have to meet Bruno after 2 weeks to give a first presentation of your work, after completing a tested mid-fidelity prototype. 

The final presentation of your work will take place 2 weeks after the mid presentation, where you’ll show a tested high-fidelity prototype.

Estimated time: 4 weeks

Team size: 3 people max

Guidelines: 

- You may consider building your UX and UI strategy before jumping in. Remember to question the initial brief with user research.
- Beware all the steps of the design process: Empathy, Define, Problem Statement, Ideation, Prototype, Test
- Make a presentation as if you were showing your work to your client. Make sure there are at least 5 people in the audience who can give consistent feedback thanks to the audit.
