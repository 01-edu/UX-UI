# Project 4: A table !

Creation of a room booking service on desktop

DeliverNow is a company that helps restaurants deliver take-away food, thanks to a series of runners.

They recently had bad comments from customers:

‘Our customers currently face problems with wrong estimated delivery times, the amount of unnecessary cutlery and condiments. 

Our runners complain about the allocation of routes among them. 

The managers can’t manage their drivers well since they don’t have a clear enough vision of the runners. 

Finally, the restaurants complain because they have a hard time managing the preparation of the food on-site and take-away.’

Thus, they ask your team to redesign the full experience: 

- For customers
- For restaurants
- For runners
- For runner’s managers

You have to meet your client after 3 weeks to give a first presentation of your work, after completing a tested mid-fidelity prototype. 

The final presentation of your work will take place 2 weeks after the mid presentation, where you’ll show a tested high-fidelity prototype.

Estimated time: 5 weeks

Team size: max 3 people

Guidelines: 

- You may consider building your UX and UI strategy before jumping in. Remember to question the initial brief with user research.
- In this context, 4 users = 4 personas = 4 user journeys = 4 prototypes
- Beware all the steps of the design process: Empathy, Define, Problem Statement, Ideation, Prototype, Test
- In your prototypes, if necessary, show your audience the user journey for each persona when there is one order.
- Make a presentation as if you were showing your work to your client. Make sure there are at least 5 people in the audience who can give consistent feedback thanks to the audit.
