# UX III - Ex 6 CK - User Journey

**Context:** 

Quest n°3 is about Empathy. 

In this scenario, the principal of your high school heard you were a designer. They chose to reach you to help them face school harassment among teenagers.

School harassment describes school-based harassment behaviors. It is characterized by the repeated use of violence, including mockery and other humiliations.

As a matter of fact, they realized they didn’t know this generation (15 to 18-year-olds) very well. So they are asking you to conduct user research to meet this population and understand them. 

Your job is to explore your topic and use various tools included in this “Empathize” phase.

**Instructions:** 

Now you have your persona, it's time to set it in motion. 

Design a User Journey to represent your persona in their environment across the time, with key steps or actions related to our current topic (harassment). 

The timeline can be of a day, a few hours, or a week. Please include the key moments related to harassment alongside the emotions related to each step. Use the material from your interviews and surveys.

Then, highlight the main pain points that need to be solved.

**Deliverable:** 

- Your persona's user journey

**Resources:** 

Most articles you'll find will be about user journeys or customer journeys. Keep in mind that you can adapt this methodology to any persona with any kind of situation or process, even at school, outside the school, in the digital world, etc.
